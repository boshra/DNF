DNF
===

A dynamic neural field implementation in both 1d and 2d.


Modules:
=======
-dnf_1d.py: A dynamic neural field implementation with path integration and
	multiple bubble capabilities.

-dnf_2d.py: A dynamic neural field implementation that uses convolutions to
	make the computationally expensive 2d DNFs runnable on lesser machines.
